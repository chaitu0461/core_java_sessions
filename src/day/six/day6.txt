Overriding Rules
===========
1. There should be parent child relation ship
2. Method name, arguments , method return types should be same in child class
3.child class cannot decrease visibility of parent (access modifiers related)
4. Child class can either have same return type or a subclass return type

visibility order
public>protected>private

Over Loading Rules
=======================
1. Here parent child relation ship is optional
2. We can overload in the same class
rule 1: return type should be same
rule 2: method argument data type or number of method arguments should be different

Object Class
==============
It is the parent of every object in java
Object class has some methods . Every class inherits the method
Two of the important method is equals and hash code
equals is used for checking equality of two objects
toString method .. it is used to give the string representation of object
by default , the toString method gives Object@hashcode
whenever you call System.out.println(object variable), objects to string method will be called
you can override your own toString method

Some predefined classes in java have overridden tostring method

googling 
=========
find out what are the other object methods

exercise
==========
try to simulate null pointer exception
